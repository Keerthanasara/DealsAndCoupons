# Deals-and-Coupons-Finder-App-using-Java
Here I used Java + Springboot + MongoDB + Junit & Mokito.
Java is used for writing the code.
Springboot is a tool used to create spring projects in very less painfull way,so i used springframeworks here and followed layered architecture.
Mongodb is a nosql database used to store the data.
Junit&Mokito is used here for unit testing. 
This is backend part of Deals And Coupons Finder App and it is the updated one. I used Java and springframework for this app. I integrated this backend part to my UI, which is frontend of deals and coupons finder app.
